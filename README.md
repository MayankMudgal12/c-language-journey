# Chapter 1 ‚Äì Introduction to C

In this chapter, I learned the basic building blocks of the C programming language.  
The focus was on understanding how a simple C program is structured and how to write, compile, and run it.

### üìò Topics Covered
- Variables and Data Types  
- Input/Output functions (`printf`, `scanf`)  
- Keywords and Identifiers  
- Comments in C  
- Basic Program Structure  
- Compilation Process  

### üìù Practice Problems
- Calculate the area of a circle  
- Calculate the area of a square  

### üíª Code Files
 
- [area of circle.c.c](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21813446/area.of.circle.c.c)
- [area of square.c](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21813444/area.of.square.c)
  

This is the first step of my C learning journey. üöÄ  
I will keep updating this repository with each chapter I complete.  



# CHAPTER 2 ‚Äì INSTRUCTIONS & OPERATORS (C LANGUAGE)

Today I studied Instructions and Operators in C:

- Instructions ‚Üí Type declaration, Arithmetic, Control (sequence, decision, loop, case).

- Operators ‚Üí Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Assignment, Bitwise, Ternary.

- Operator Precedence & Associativity ‚Üí Rules that decide execution order in expressions.

I also solved the following problems in C:

1. Write a program to check if a number is divisible by 2 or not.
[Q1.c](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21941756/Q1.c) 

2. Write a program to print the average of 3 numbers.
[Q2.c](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21941759/Q2.c)


3. Write a program to check if a given character is a digit or not.
 
[Q3.C](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21941763/Q3.C)

## chapter 3
C Programming: Conditional Statements ‚Äî Chapter Completion and Practice
I have successfully completed the chapter on Conditional Statements in C programming. This chapter enhanced my understanding of decision-making structures such as if, else if, and else statements, which are fundamental for controlling the flow of a program based on conditions.

As part of my practice, I solved four programming questions that reinforced the concepts learned:

Q1 Pass/Fail Check: A simple program to check if marks scored are greater than 30 to determine pass or fail.

A2 Grade Assignment: Program to assign grades based on marks using multiple if-else if statements.

Q3 Uppercase Check: A program to check if an entered character is an uppercase alphabet.

Q4 Armstrong Number: A program to check if a three-digit number is an Armstrong number by summing the cubes of its digits.

These solutions involved the use of conditional branching, logical operators, and basic input/output operations.


# C Programming: Chapter 4 - Loops

I've completed Chapter 4 of my C programming journey, focusing on mastering loops. This repository contains the code for the practice problems I solved to solidify my understanding of `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops, as well as the `break` and `continue` statements.

### **Problems Solved**

-   `Q1.c`: A basic `while` loop to print numbers up to a user-defined input.
-   `Q2.c`: A `do-while` loop used to calculate the sum of numbers up to a given integer.
-   `Q3.c` & `Q4.c`: Demonstrations of the `break` statement to exit a `do-while` loop based on specific user input (odd number or multiple of 7).
-   `Q5.c`: An example of the `continue` statement inside a `for` loop to skip iterations and print only odd numbers.
-   `Q6.c`: A `for` loop to calculate the factorial of a number.

Feel free to explore the code and see how these fundamental looping concepts are applied.
