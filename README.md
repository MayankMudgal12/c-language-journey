- Input/Output functions (`printf`, `scanf`)  
- Keywords and Identifiers  
- Comments in C  
- Basic Program Structure  
- Compilation Process  

### 📝 Practice Problems
- Calculate the area of a circle  
- Calculate the area of a square  

### 💻 Code Files

- [area of square.c](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21813444/area.of.square.c)
  

This is the first step of my C learning journey. 🚀  
I will keep updating this repository with each chapter I complete.
